## About Starblast Arena Initial
The Starblast Arena Initial mod is a version of the Starblast Arena that focuses on alien encounters. Unlike the standard Team Fights mode, this variant incorporates custom ships and introduces a more chaotic and unbalanced gameplay experience.

In this mod, players engage in intense battles against each other within an arena filled with formidable aliens and moving asteroids. The primary objective is to eliminate both players and aliens to accumulate points. The game is won by reaching a specific point threshold.

It's important to note that this version of the Starblast Arena differs from the Team Fights mode by introducing custom ships, unbalanced gameplay elements, and a strong emphasis on combating powerful aliens. This variation adds an additional layer of challenge and excitement to the gameplay experience.
