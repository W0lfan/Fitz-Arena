<h1>Starblast Arena</h1>
<br>
Starblast Arena is a starblast mod with custom tree. 
After the phase of mining, players will have to survive in a chaotic environment. They have to collect points by killing aliens & players, and the first to reach 25 000 points wins. Dying makes your team losing points.<br><br>
Players will have access to "capacities" after the mining phase, such as:
<br/>
:skull: Petrification: gain the ability to freeze your enemies for x seconds.<br/>
:zap: Electricity: damage all your enemies of x damages.<br/>
:cyclone: Teleportation: gain the ability to be teleported randomly on the map with x seconds of invulnerability.<br/>
:herb: Healer: gain the ability to be healer for x seconds.<br/>
:shield: Bodyguard: summon 3 piranhas (it will be removed).<br/>
:drop_of_blood: Vampire: All the player will be damaged to heal you. You will lose the number of shield points you gained.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
 <b>What is "x"?</b><br/>
Basically, defense pods will appear randomly on the map. These defense pods will constitute the charges of the battery you have. Max battery charge is 3. x depend on the number of charges you battery have: 1, 2 or 3. However, you have 1 chance on 5 to get a corrupted battery which will reduce the total charge of battery you have (-1). If you already have 0 charges then you won't lose any charge.
