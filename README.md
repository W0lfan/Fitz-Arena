<h1>Starblast Arena</h1>
<br>
Starblast Arena is a starblast mod with a custom ship tree currently composed of 12 custom tier 6 ships.
This mod uses a custom scoreboard and UIs.
In this mod, players will have to kill a certain amount of aliens and players to win the game. 
Players will be able to choose a ship when spawning or respawning in game. They'll have 30 seconds to choose their ship after being randomly teleported.
Some features and easter-eggs are hidden in the mode.
